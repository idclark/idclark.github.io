Hi, my name is Ian this is my personal site. I'm a data scientist who has spent the last eight years supporting enterprise level accounts in fintech, infosec, and now adtech. After stints in Boston, New York City, Baltimore, and London I now reside in Chicago. My research interests include American politics, applied statistics, and finance with machine learning sprinkled on top of each. Outside of the office I live for marathons, cycling and long course triathlons.
